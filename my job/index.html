        <h3 class="section-title">who is Victor?</h3><br>
        <p><strong>Victor</strong>, a young Nigerian whose love for people around him is so triggering. He is barely 35, but full of love in him, He believes in the philosophy that an act of little kindness cannot make one poor.</p><br>
        <p>I always see people around him which triggered my curiosity, at first, I thought he is a millionare , in the course of my findings, I asked one of his friends the reason behind such huge crowd around him and in reply he says "Victor is a man of
            good spirit and full of love, he is full of good vibes, positivity and believes in the progress of another man, irrespective of their relatioship." I thought he was just over exegerating and asked him if it is because of his money, but here
            is what he replied, " in terms of money, i'm richer than him, i do not believe is has more than two hundred thousand naira in his account and even if he has, it is not for him alone because he is ready to solve his friends' problems with it,
            even for a total stranger."
        </p><br>

        <p>This marvelled me, I was speechless, such a young man in his prime should be aspiring for fancy cars, mansions, huge amount of money in his account as others within his age, but instead, he is inspired by <strong>love for humanity</strong> I could
            not believe what I heard, I decided to try him, I got his contact and wrote him on WhatsApp, and he read my message without reply. To me, I was thinking he is not as was described, but in the evening of the next day, he replied, " send your
            account details", I hurriedly did and within some minutes, I got an alert.

        </p><br>

            <p>After some weeks, I found out he borrowed the money from his girlfriend. <strong>Victor</strong>who are you? You are so possessed by multiple spirits of <strong>love, kindness, Honesty and Humanitarian aid.</strong> Like he always said " if
                you can sleep comfortably in the night while hearing the cry of your neighbour then you are a real devil". .
